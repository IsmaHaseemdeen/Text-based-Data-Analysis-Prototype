Text-based Data Analysis Prototype - Dream Bookshop
Dream Book Shop, a well-established comic book retailer, has recently expanded its physical operations and enhanced its eCommerce platform as part of a broader digital transformation initiative. To further elevate user experience and strengthen digital engagement, the shop is developing a data analytics solution that begins with a Command-Line Interface (CLI) data analysis application. This application serves as a proof of concept for a future interactive dashboard, utilizing historical comic book metadata from the British National Bibliography (BNB). It provides valuable insights such as publication trends over time, the top five most prolific authors, language distribution of books, the number of books published by each publisher, and an analysis of missing ISBN records—including both count and percentage. Additionally, it examines the number of books published per year categorized by language.

The project adopts Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles combined with SOLID design practices, design patterns, and clean coding methodologies to ensure scalability, maintainability, and long-term reliability. By structuring the application around robust software engineering principles, Dream Book Shop aims to create a durable foundation for future data-driven tools. This approach not only supports efficient data analysis but also ensures that the upcoming interactive dashboard will be adaptable and extensible, aligning with the shop’s commitment to innovation and continuous improvement in customer engagement.
